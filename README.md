<!-- Well then, here's what we can do...-->

<h2>Welcome to the Mind Screw!</h2>
<p>This is a space for Meepers to learn and work with NH-Carrigan on their passion projects as well as finding practice stuff. We are trying our best, despite being disabled.</p>
<p>NH-Carrigan is allowed to add practice materials here at her own discretion. We've been working hard learning this for a while now, so this will be interesting.</p>

<h3>So, what's up with the informality? This isn't how most work!</h3>
<p>Many developers and coders use formal language and sometimes make sections way too complicated for the average person to read, so we're gonna try to keep this informal and accessible as possible so you don't get lost as much as for our own benefit.</p>
<p>Seriously, trust me, you'll thank me later for making this a lot easier on everyone. Plus, I think this adds some personality too.</p>
